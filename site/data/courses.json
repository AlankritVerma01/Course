The project will culminate in a written report in the form of a thesis and a poster presentation. During the course of the year, at appropriate times, students will meet to present their own research proposals, to appraise the proposals of others, and to discuss the results of their investigation. Students must first find a supervisor, which is usually confirmed before the start of the academic term in which the project will be initiated. Students will meet as a group with the coordinator as well as individually with their supervisor. Preference in this course is given to Specialists in Neuroscience with a cumulative GPA of 3.3 or higher. Students planning to pursue graduate studies are especially encouraged to enrol in the course. Students must obtain a permission form from the Department of Psychology's website that is to be completed and signed by the intended supervisor, and submitted to the Psychology Office. At that time, the student will be provided with an outline of the schedule and general requirements for the course.
